## Wine Quality Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project presents a detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the Wine Quality dataset using Python. It aims to uncover insights into the chemical properties of wine and their impact on quality ratings, using statistical methods and rich visualizations. The project was developed using **Jupyter Notebook** within **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – visualizations
- **Plotly** – interactive visualizations
- **SciPy** – statistical analysis

## Dataset
- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)
- Contains physicochemical data and sensory quality ratings for red and white wine samples.
